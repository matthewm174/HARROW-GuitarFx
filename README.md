Starting this project to learn some things about audio processing via Juce (and coincidentally C++!), the source files are all that's in this repo. If you want to build it yourself, download Projucer, create a new project with the 'basic plugin' setup and include dsp libs and import the files. I compiled on Windows using VS2022.

Quick Video of the plugin in action:
